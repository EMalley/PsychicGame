# Psychic Game
 This is a basic Javascript built game that requires the user to guess a letter A-Z that the computer picks randomly. The player has 10 guesses to choose the correct letter. 
 When the game has ended a score is either added to a "wins" or "losses" counter. 
 This assignment was a to get comfortable with writing vanilla Javascript and to create a CPU vs Player type game.
